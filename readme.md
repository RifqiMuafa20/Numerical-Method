There are two cases of finding the roots of an equation using a computer program

---

1. Case 1

```

The velocity v of a falling parachutist is given by:

```
v =  gm/c (1-e^(-(c‚ÅÑ(m)t)))
```

where g = 9.8 m/s2. For a parachutist with a drag coefficient c = 25 kg/s
compute the mass m so that the velocity is v = 55 m/s at  t = 15 s. 

```

2. Case 2

```

Determine the root of the following function,

```
f(x) = (5-(5*(x))-(e^(x/2)))
```

```
